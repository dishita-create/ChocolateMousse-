 1. Whip egg yolks and sugar: In medium mixing bowl using an electric hand mixer whip together egg yolks and granulated sugar on high speed until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. 
     
  2. Heat 3/4 cup cream: Warm 3/4 cup of the heavy cream in a 2-quart saucepan on the stovetop over low heat    until hot. 

  3. Temper eggs with cream mixture: While whisking egg mixture slowly pour in warm cream mixture to temper egg yolks. Then pour combined egg yolk and cream mixture back into saucepan. 

  4. Cook mixture to 160 degrees: Cook over low heat, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens just slightly and reaches 160 degrees on an instant read thermometer. If you notice any clumps strain through a sieve and return to saucepan. 

  5. Melt in chocolate: Off heat add in chocolate, stir until melted.

  6. Let cool to room temp: Pour mixture into a clean medium bowl, cover and chill, stirring about every 10 – 15 minutes until it reaches 70 degrees (or no longer warm), about 30 – 40 minutes total. 

  7. Whip remaining cream, fold into chocolate mixture: Whip remaining heavy cream until very stiff peaks form. Fold whipped cream into chocolate mixture until combined.

  8. Divide mixture among dessert cups, chill: Pipe or spoon into dessert cups. Chill 2 hours. Top with sweetened whipped cream if desired and garnish with shaved or grated chocolate.**
